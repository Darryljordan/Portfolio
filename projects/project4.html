    <h2 data-i18n="project4_title">Library App</h2>
    
    <p data-i18n="project4_description">The Library App is a full-stack web application I'm developing to modernize the management of a private book collection. This project showcases my end-to-end development capabilities, as I'm solely responsible for all aspects from design and architecture to implementation and deployment.</p>
    
    <p>While the application is being developed for a specific client and contains some copyrighted resources (preventing public access), this project demonstrates my ability to create complete, production-ready applications using modern web technologies.</p>

    <h3>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h3>
    <p>This project presented several interesting technical challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complex Data Relationships:</strong> The library catalog required handling complex relationships between books, authors, categories, and user interactions. I designed a normalized database schema with efficient queries to manage these relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Users needed powerful search capabilities across multiple fields with relevance ranking. I implemented an advanced search system with filters, facets, and full-text search capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive UI:</strong> The application needed to work seamlessly across devices. I built a responsive React frontend with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a consistent user experience from smartphones to desktops.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication & Authorization:</strong> Different user roles required different access levels. I implemented a JWT-based authentication system with role-based access controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React.js with hooks, context API for state management, and styled-components for styling</li>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express, creating RESTful APIs and middleware for business logic</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL for flexible document storage, with Sequelize for schema validation</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> JWT-based authentication with secure cookie storage and refresh token rotation</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests, and Cypress for E2E testing</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Docker containers with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Catalog Management:</strong> Comprehensive system for adding, editing, and organizing books with metadata</li>
      <li><strong>User Management:</strong> Role-based access control with different permissions for administrators and regular users</li>
      <li><strong>Lending System:</strong> Digital tracking of book borrowing with due dates, notifications, and history</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Search:</strong> Multi-faceted search with filters for genres, authors, publication dates, and availability</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Visual reports on collection composition, popular books, and lending patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> Optimized experience across all device sizes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Development Approach</h3>
    <p>As the sole developer on this project, I implemented a structured development approach:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Started with detailed requirements gathering and user story mapping</li>
      <li>Developed the backend and frontend in parallel, using feature branches and incremental delivery</li>
      <li>Implemented automated testing at multiple levels to ensure quality</li>
      <li>Established a CI/CD pipeline for consistent, reliable deployments</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This ongoing project showcases my full-stack development capabilities and my ability to independently deliver a complete, production-quality application that solves real business needs. It equally shows my ability to adapt to new technologies and frameworks.</p>
